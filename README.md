## Features

- **🐦‍🔥 Embedded LiveView** - Mount the dashboard directly in your application without any
  external dependencies.

- **📊 Realtime Charts** - Powered by a custom, distributed time-series data store that's compacted
  for hours of efficient storage and filterable by node, queue, state, and worker.

- **🛸 Live Updates** - Monitor background job activity across all queues and nodes in real
  time, with customizable refresh rates and automatic pausing on blur.

- **🔍 Powerful Filtering** - Intelligently filter jobs by worker, queue, args, tags and more with
  auto-completed suggestions.

- **🔬 Detailed Inspection** - View job details including when, where and how it was ran (or how
  it failed to run).

- **🔄 Batch Actions** - Cancel, delete and retry selected jobs or all jobs matching the current
  filters.

- **🎛️ Queue Controls** - Scale, pause, resume, and stop queues across all running nodes. Queues
  running with [Oban Pro](https://oban.pro) can also edit global limits, rate limiting, and
  partitioning.

- **♊ Multiple Dashboards** - Switch between all running Oban instance from a single mount point,
  or restrict access to some dashboards with exclusion controls.

- **🔒 Access Control** - Allow admins to control queues and interract with jobs while restricting
  other users to read-only use of the dashboard.

- **🎬 Action Logging** - Use telemetry events to instrument and report all of a user's dashboard
  activity. A telemetry-powered logger is provided for easy reporting.

iex -S mix dev
```
